# Introduction
- These documents are intended for people who studied computer science about 20 years ago and learned the basics of web app development at that time but haven't been keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in web development or people close to that state.

- The main goal is to let participants experience the fun and excitement of modern web application development through hands-on experience, rather than gaining knowledge from these materials. Information necessary to learn modern web application development is provided as reference links.

# Notes
- Originally, these materials were designed for teachers in the ICT Department of Chulabhorn Science High School Chiangrai. However, the intended audience is as described above.
- I've used an AI language model (such as ChatGPT, Bard) to help prepare the documents.
- These documents provide information about the current technology stacks at the time of writing, but please be aware that technologies are constantly evolving and these information may become outdated in the very near future.
