# Introduction
This documents are intended for people who studied computer science about 20 years ago and learned the basics of web app development at that time but haven't been keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in web development or people close to that state.

# Notes
I've used chatGPT in some places: This indicates that the speaker used an AI language model (such as ChatGPT) to help prepare the documents.

These documents provide information about the current technology stacks at the time of writing, but please be aware that technologies are constantly evolving and these information may become outdated in the very near future.
