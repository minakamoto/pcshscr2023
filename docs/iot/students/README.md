### The relationship between microcontrollers and the IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology in which various devices and equipment are connected to the Internet to collect and share data to create more efficient and convenient systems.

Microcontrollers play a central role in the IoT.

Microcontrollers are responsible for controlling these devices and equipment, processing data from sensors and controlling actuators.  
For example, in a smart home lighting system, the microcontroller receives instructions from the user's smartphone to adjust the brightness of a light bulb.

Microcontrollers are considered the ideal technology for IoT devices because of their small size and low power consumption. In addition, microcontrollers often use a real-time operating system (RTOS), which provides real-time responses and very decisive responses to external events.
Therefore, the use of microcontrollers is closely related to the development of the IoT. By understanding and utilizing microcontrollers, the full potential of the IoT can be realized.

## IoT Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Sports and Wearable Technology

Do you know what devices professional soccer players wear on their chests during games?

The following website is for your reference.

At first glance, it may look like a small piece of equipment, but it is actually an important tool that can greatly affect an athlete's performance.
The device is equipped with sensors such as GPS and accelerometers that collect a variety of data in real time, including the athlete's heart rate, speed, distance, and acceleration.

At the heart of the device is a microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data from the sensors and controls the wireless communications.

Such a device is called wearable technology.

By analyzing this data, coaches and trainers can evaluate the effectiveness of training and help prevent injuries by analyzing the athlete's mileage, speed, acceleration, and other data.

Athletes can also gain an objective understanding of their own performance and receive feedback on how to improve.
