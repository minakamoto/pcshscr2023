# Fun 30-minute experiences with the latest web app development technology

## Introduction

These contents are designed to provide a fun 30-minute experience with the latest web app development technology in a web app class for high school freshmen or junior high school students.

As much as possible, the contents are designed to be completed in a single session. Because the focus is on the experience of developing, there is almost no explanation of the technology or code. This is because it is best to learn by oneself by gaining interest through experience rather than learning from others.

## Tips

The summary of the key points of the latest web app technologies and trends:

- Focus on UI/UX beyond just code.
- The frameworks/tools around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript is critical for creating rich UI/UX.
- Mobile-first design is essential due to the increased use of mobile devices.
- Use web app tech to also build mobile apps.

## Notes

- I've used an AI language model (such as ChatGPT, Bard) to help prepare the documents.
- These documents provide information about the current technology stacks at the time of writing, but please be aware that technologies are constantly evolving and these information may become outdated in the very near future.
