### The relationship between microcontrollers and the IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology in which various devices and equipment are connected to the Internet to collect and share data to create more efficient and convenient systems.

Microcontrollers play a central role in the IoT.

Microcontrollers are responsible for controlling these devices and equipment, processing data from sensors and controlling actuators.  
For example, in a smart home lighting system, the microcontroller receives instructions from the user's smartphone to adjust the brightness of a light bulb.

Microcontrollers are considered the ideal technology for IoT devices because of their small size and low power consumption. In addition, microcontrollers often use a real-time operating system (RTOS), which provides real-time responses and very decisive responses to external events.
Therefore, the use of microcontrollers is closely related to the development of the IoT. By understanding and utilizing microcontrollers, the full potential of the IoT can be realized.
