# Introduction to various XR cases

## Introduction

This document is intended to introduce examples of XR applications to junior high school students learning the basics of ICT and to encourage interest in ICT technology.

## TIPS

### What is XR

XR stands for **Extended Reality** and is a generic term for technologies that merge the real world with the virtual world to enable the perception of things that are not real, thus technologies such as **VR** (Virtual Reality), **AR** (Augmented Reality), and **MR** (Mixed Reality) are all included in XR.

#### What is VR

**VR** stands for **Virtual Reality**, a technology that allows users to experience a virtual space by completely blocking out the real world. By wearing a device such as a head-mounted display (HMD) or goggles, you can experience a virtual world in 360 degrees.VR is used in gaming and training.

#### What is AR

**AR** stands for **Augmented Reality**, a technology that augments reality by overlaying virtual information on the real world. AR is used for navigation, advertising, and other applications.

#### What is MR

**MR** stands for **Mixed Reality**, a technology that merges the real and virtual worlds to create a seamless, continuous experience of the real and virtual worlds simultaneously using devices such as HMDs and smart glasses. MR is used in manufacturing, medicine, etc.

XR has already been used in gaming and entertainment, and is expected to be used in education, medicine, manufacturing, business, and many other fields.

### What is WebXR

WebXR is an API that allows users to experience XR content through a web browser. WebXR makes it easy to experience XR content on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and PCs, without the need to install any special devices or software. In addition, because it is developed as open source, anyone can freely participate in its development, and a variety of features and applications are being developed.

Because of these features, WebXR is expected to contribute greatly to the spread of XR content. It is expected that various XR contents using WebXR will be developed and used in various fields in the future.

## XR Case Studies

### Case Study 1: XR in Education

XR technology is being used in a variety of ways in the education sector. XR brings revolutionary changes to the education sector.
XR enables a more direct and practical learning experience.

Some examples include

- Students can attend classes as if they were on site
  - Re-enact historical events and explore geographic locations
  - Conduct field research on earthquakes and disasters
- Simulate an experiment
  - Experience scientific experiments in a safe and realistic environment
